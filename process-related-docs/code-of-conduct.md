# Code of Conduct
### 1. Core agreements/axioms
**Punctuality**: Group members are deemed to be present at the exact moment as arranged (preferably 5 minutes early to grab a cosy cup of coffee). To realise punctuality we keep track of late appearance. After 3 times of showing late as a friendly punishment a person is to bake a cake for the group to enjoy together. 

**Presence**: Each group member is allowed to not be present (physically or online) 1 day a week. This will be coordinated through our presence-sheet.

**Directness**: Group members are expected to be honest and be critical towards each other. Feedback should be positive and direct.

**Majority counts**: Whenever there is division over a decision the majority of the group-members will be right. 

**Planning**: All team members are equally responsible for deadlines, deliverables etc. 

By these core agreements we believe we will have a smooth workflow.

### 3. Process-orientated
##### 3.1 Meetings
- The group is to discuss progress and problems they walked into during a meeting at the start of the day. We approximate these meetings to take no more than 30 minutes.  
-  The first morning of the week the group shall discuss the sprint for the upcoming week. This meeting will take longer than the daily meetings and requires presence of all group members. The preferred day for this is Monday.  
- Weekly meetings with the client are to be scheduled to keep the progress of the project in line with the ideas of the client.  
- Roles for meetings (i.e. chair and notetaker) will be allocated randomly every week.  
- Agendas for meetings are to be created at least the day before a meeting.

##### 3.2 GitLab 
- Merge-requests need at least 2 approvals before they can be merged.  
- Group members are expected to thoroughly review each other's code, leave comments and ask questions when unclarity arises.   
- Issues in GitLab should hold labels corresponding to their priority, which will follow a MoSCoW approach.  
- GitLab issues are to hold a status label indicating whether they are: on the backlog, being worked on, in-review or finished.  
- Merge-requests should be responded to within the next working-day as to prevent big merge-conflicts.
- Any branch to be merged to the main branch should pass the pipeline, meaning all tests and style checks have to pass.

---
### 4. Communication
- Group members are expected to check the Discord server and the WhatsApp group regularly. They are supposed to check these mediums at least twice a day.  
- Communication medium to be used with the TA and Coach is Mattermost.  
- In case of a big delay there should be an extra meeting planned with the TA to discuss resolving present issues. 

---
### 5. Product-orientated
- Code should be easy to comprehend, so that it is also easy to maintain. Where necessary appropriate comments should be placed. Comments should also not be overdone.  
- All members of the group are to contribute to the project in a meaningful way and with a high-quality, modular and maintainable final product in mind. All members work in first essence towards a good product rather than working for a high grade.
